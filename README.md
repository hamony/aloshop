# Ecommerce
Building aloshop

# Overview
This is a working draft of specification for Ecommerce system build by express. 
The system has been working round some underlying features, but especially the promotion is the hardest function that I spent more time, I did and tested it over and over again to make sure that function works as expectation. As well as I did epxress my idea about how to build ecommerce system with high traffic and easy to expand horizontally.
Addition in to loose couple and high cohesion of interaction between class and MVC model. This is absolutely awesome job I've done so far, I don't have enough time to write test code though. 
# Getting Started
### How to setup and config
Make sure you already installed **Docker and Docker Compose** on your machine.
Navigate to `root folder`
RUN `docker-compose up -d` 
At first time, it will take time to build containers and other involving.

Great! We have finished some stuff, let's go and play around.
